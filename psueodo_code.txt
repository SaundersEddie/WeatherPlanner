        Current weather data        Can use City or Zip -   https://openweathermap.org/current 
        5 day / 3 hour forecast     Can Use City or Zip -   https://openweathermap.org/forecast5
        UV Index                    This requires LAT/LON to get the result -   https://openweathermap.org/api/uvi

        openweathermap also includes a reference to a weather image.
 
    Layout
        Could never find if Bootstrap included a reset css, so include it
        Bootstrap for general layout. Investigate cards for the 5 day forecast

    JS
        We'll need JQuery
        May need moment JS
        All Bootstrap JS includes

    Define variables
        We'll need to store all relevant information in an object or array
            Here's our location details opbject:
            const locationDetails = {
                geoLocation: {lon: 0.00, lat: 0.00},
                currentWeather: {date: "", name: "", temp: 0.00, humidity: 0, uvIndex: 0, icon: ""},
                day1Weather: {day1date: "", day1Temp: 0.00, day1Humidity: 0, day1Icon: ""},
                day2Weather: {day2date: "", day2Temp: 0.00, day2Humidity: 0, day2Icon: ""},
                day3Weather: {day3date: "", day3Temp: 0.00, day3Humidity: 0, day3Icon: "" },
                day4Weather: {day4date: "", day4Temp: 0.00, day4Humidity: 0, day4Icon: "" },
                day5Weather: {day5date: "", day5Temp: 0.00, day5Humidity: 0, day5Icon: ""},
                };

                We would then create new instances of this with a let or var "var KansasCity = Object.create(locationDetails);"

            We can use an array to keep track of the 8 prior locations searched:
                var locationsSearched = ["","","","","","","",""];
                We can check to see if a location is in the array already, if so, we won't add it to the list, if it isnt we add it in
                if list is full we shift array items to the right and add new location to top
                When we tie this into our location list, can we make this list clickable?


    Screen plot:
        Header bar (not necessarily a bootstrap header) 100% across screen
            May include an option for C/F displays in this header

        Grid on the left hand side including: Probably 33% of screen
            Input box for API 
                Should we do a way to distinguish what user has entered
            List of 8-10 prior searched locations
        Grid on right hand side of screen 66% side, 50% height?
            Current weather for user entered locations
            This shows the following:
                City name
                Weather Type Icon
                Temp
                Humidity
                Wind Speed
                UV Index
                    UV Index is colour coded to it's health ratinf
                    <2 green, 3-6 Yellow, 7-9 Red, 10+ Purple
        Grid on right of screen, 66% wide, 50% height?
            5 day forecast for user entered location
            These should include the following:
                Date
                Weather Type Icon
                Temp
                Humidity
            Can probably use Bootstrap cards for this

        
    Nice shit:
        Appropriately coloured backgrounds
        Fancy effects around the various grid boxes, maybe a slight shadow
        Option for C/F/K display
        Include option for rouding of temp to whole number, very few people give a crap about the .xx

    Maybe include a full page advert every 30 seconds just like the bastards at real weather sites seem to do... :)
